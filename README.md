<h1>Documentation for Linear Regression Code</h1>
Overview:
This code performs linear regression for predicting house prices based on multiple variables (features) such as area, number of bedrooms, and age of the house. The linear regression model is trained using the scikit-learn library, and the user can input specific features to predict the price of a house.

Steps:
Importing Relevant Packages:

Imported necessary packages such as pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib for visualization, and scikit-learn for machine learning.
Reading Dataset:

Loaded a dataset from a CSV file named "homeprices.csv" using pandas.
Displayed the first few rows of the dataset and provided summary information about the data.
Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values in the 'bedrooms' column by filling them with the median value.
Training Linear Regression Model:

Selected independent variables ('area', 'bedrooms', 'age') and defined the dependent variable ('price').
Created a linear regression model using scikit-learn's LinearRegression class.
Fitted the model using the training data.
Predicting House Price:

Gathered user input for the area, number of bedrooms, and age of the house.
Used the trained model to predict the house price based on the input features.
Printed the predicted price value.
Linear Regression Equation:

Displayed the coefficients (slopes) and intercept of the linear regression model.
Presented the multivariate linear regression equation:
makefile

price = area * 112.06 + bedrooms * 23388.88 + age * -3231.72 + 21323.00
Note:
The user can input specific features to get a predicted house price.
The linear regression equation shows the contribution of each feature to the predicted price.
The code provides a simple implementation for predicting house prices based on given features.
